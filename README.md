# MongooseCRUD
A basic, barebones CRUD application that demonstrates the use of the Mongoose ORM and the basic HTTP methods including
PUT, POST, DELETE, GET. Using the Postman web API testing application I was able to show the succesful connection from the 
cloud based MongoDB database to the routes and endpoints specified.


## Motivation
This project was intended to solidify and practice the MVC architecture style as well as the database CRUD operations.
